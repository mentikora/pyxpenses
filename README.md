# Python Training Projects

A collection of small to medium-sized Python projects created for learning and practice.
Each project explores different aspects of Python programming â€” from basic syntax and data structures to working with libraries,databases, and APIs.

> The ideas and inspiration for these projects came from conversations with **ChatGPT**.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple folders, each representing a separate project:

> /project-1-name
>
> /project-2-name
>
> /project-3-name
>
> ...

Each project typically contains:

- **Source code** (`.py` files)
- **README.md** (with project-specific details if needed)
- **pyproject.toml** (if extra dependencies are used)

## Usage

```
./starter.sh --name=YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

```
pre-commit install
```
